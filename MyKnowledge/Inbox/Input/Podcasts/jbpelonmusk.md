# JBP&ElonMusk

- TimeStamp:1:04:14 People arn't commiting to the future or eachother
- Having a kid that means you care about the future you beleive in the future
- Having a child and believing in it's potential is the most optimistic thing a person can do

- The future is always a challenge
- The moral thing to do is to have faith and courage in the future regardless of the data
- Because you can say look at all the suffering of life and the abundance of possible horrors of the future
- There's an ethical requirement that's associated with living in the matter that would justify your life even to yourself to have faith and courage into the future. __NO MATTER WHAT__
