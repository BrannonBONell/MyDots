# Devops Goals and benefits

## Benefits from DevOps

1. __Accelerating time to market:__
	1. Implementing DevOps facilitates rapid release of software and updates. Acceleration increases responsiveness to evolving needs of consumer.
2. __Adapting to market dynamics and competition__:
	1. Allows to quickly adapt to changes in the market and respond to competition. Ensures ability to adjust to consumer expectations.
3. __Sustain stability and reliability in operations__:
	1. Emphasizes collaboration between development and operations teams, providing more stable and reliable operation environments. This helps identify and address issues early in development, minimizing disruptions and increasing the overall stability of the operational environment.
4. __Minimizing the mean time to recovery (MTTR):__
	1. DevOps focuses on automation, continuous monitoring, and rapid feedback loops, leading to quicker detection and solutions of issues.  This significantly improves the MTTR, minimizing any disruption and operations are quickly restored to optimal state.

## DevOps Benefits extend past traditional applications

Machine learning (with operations applied to implementing machine learning models) and infrastructure (with infrastructure as Code applied to deployment of underlying platform services.)

- __Machine Learning Operations__:
	- Or MLOps focus on the transition from the development of models to the provisioning in a production environment.  By following MLOps it can ensure that workloads are resilient and can be easily recreated.  Including
		- Monitoring
		- Retraining
		- Redeploying models on an as needed basis
		- Maintaining stability for subsequent deployments

- __Infrastructure as code:__
	- or IaC manages and provisions compute, networking, and storage infrastructure via programming methods, rather than using hardware or interactive admin tools.  IaC Allows to define and manage infrastructure elements such as:
		- Servers
		- Network Devices
		- Databases
	- Using code
	- The code is typically written in high level human readable scripting language.
	- Scripts are executed to automate the provisioning and configuration of infrastructure making it more:
		- Efficient
		- Consistent
		- Easily scalable.
