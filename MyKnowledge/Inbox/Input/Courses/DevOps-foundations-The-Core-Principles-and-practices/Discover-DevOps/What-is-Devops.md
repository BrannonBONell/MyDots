# What is DevOps

DevOps is a set of principles, practices and values that improve cross-team cooperation, with a target of optimizing software development.

Its not an end state but rather a continuous adventure that requires ongoing effort from all stakeholders.

DevOps is also not bound to any specific technology or tools.

Rather than the traditional way of software development, where the development team and operations team work in silos.

### What challenges are associated with traditional application life cycles

In a traditional software lifecycle the developing of software and operationalizing it are separate. This approach obviously leads to many inefficiencies.

Developers and operational teams usually have different objectives.  Developers tend to focus on innovation and continual improvements to their software.  Operational teams usually have the goal of maintaining the stability and security of the the environment they support.

Conflicting goals result in conflict, driving a block between different parts of the internal IT organization.

Traditional operational practices are often outdated, largely manual approach, which is slow and vulnerable to human errors.  This impairs the pace of innovation and increases the level of risk associated with deployment of new or updated versions of the application.

### How does DevOps Help

- Uniting people
- processes
- and technologies
	- DevOps encourages coordination and collaboration between the developers and Operational team, increasing areas:
		- Development
