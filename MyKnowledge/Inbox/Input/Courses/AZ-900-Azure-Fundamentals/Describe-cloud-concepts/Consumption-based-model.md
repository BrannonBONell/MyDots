# IT infrastructure models

- Two types of expenses
	- Capital expenditure (CapEx)\
	- Operational expenditure (OpEx)

- CapEx is usually a on-time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure resources.
	- A new building, repaving the parking lot, building a datacenter, or buying a company vehicle are all examples of CapEx
- OpEx is spending money on services or products over time
	- Renting a convention center, leasing a company vehicle, or signing up for cloud services are all examples of OpEx.

- Cloud computing of course is OpEx
	- Operates on a consumption-based model.
	- You don't pay for physical infrastructure, electricity, security, or anything else associated with maintaining a datacenter.
	- You pay for the IT resources you use
		- IF you don't use any IT resources this month you don't pay for any

- This consumption-based model has many benefits,
	- No upfront costs
	- No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest potential.
	- The Ability to pay for more resources when they are needed
	- The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed

- In a Traditional datacenter
	- You try to estimate the future resource needs.
	- If you overestimate you spend more on your datacenter than you need to and are potentially wasting money.
	- If you underestimate your datacenter will quickly reach capacity and your applications and services may suffer from decreased performance.
	- Fixing and under-provisioned datacenters can take a long time
	- You may need to order, receive, and install more hardware
		- You'll also need to add power, cooling, and networking for the extra hardware

- In a cloud-based model
	- The worry about getting the resource amount right is lifted.
	- If you need more VM, you add more
	- If the demand drops and you don't need as many VMs, you remove them as needed
	- You're only paying for the VMs that you use, not the "extra capacity" that the cloud provider has on hand.

# Compare cloud pricing models

- Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model.
- Typically pay only for the cloud services you use which helps
	- Plan and manage your operating costs
	- Run your infrastructure more effciently
	- Scale as your business needs change

- Cloud computing is a way to rent compute power and storage from someone else's datacenter.
- Treat cloud resources like you would treat resources from your own datacenter BUT:
	- When you're done using cloud resources you give them back
		- and your only billed for what you used

- Instead of maintaining the hardware in your datacenter
	- You rent them for the time that you need them.
	- The cloud provider takes care of maintaining the underlying infrastructure for you.
	- The cloud enables you to quickly solve your toughest business challenges and bring cutting-edge solutions to your users.
