## Question 2 of 50

What are two characteristics of the public cloud deployment model? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

### Your Answer

- Servers and storage are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider.
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    
- Services are offered over the internet and are available to anyone who wants to purchase them.
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    

### Correct Answer

- Servers and storage are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider.
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    
- Services are offered over the internet and are available to anyone who wants to purchase them.
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    

In a public cloud, services are offered over the internet and are available to anyone who wants to purchase them. A private cloud is limited to a single organization. Cloud resources, such as servers and storage, are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and delivered over the internet. A private cloud consists of computing resources used exclusively by users from one business or organization.

## Question 3 of 50

What are two characteristics of a consumption-based model? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

### Your Answer

- no upfront costs
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    
- the ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer used
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    

### Correct Answer

- no upfront costs
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    
- the ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer used
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    

In a consumption-based model, you do not pay for anything until you start using resources, and you only pay for what you use. If you stop using a resource, you stop paying for it. High expenditures are usually associated with the purchase of the physical infrastructure, which is not needed in a consumption-based model.

## Question 9 of 50

Which cloud service model provides you with the most control over the hardware that runs applications?

### Your Answer

- infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    

### Correct Answer

- infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    

IaaS is the most flexible category of cloud services. It aims to give you complete control over the hardware that runs applications. Users do not control the operating system and do not configure the underlying servers in PaaS. With SaaS, you are using as-is software hosted in the cloud, instead of creating a platform to host a software yourself.

## Question 28 of 50

What enables a user to sign in one time and use that credential to access multiple resources and applications from different providers?

### Your Answer

- single sign-on (SSO)
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    

### Correct Answer

- single sign-on (SSO)
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    

SSO enables a user to sign in one time and use that credential to access multiple resources and applications from different providers. MFA is a process whereby a user is prompted during the sign-in process for an additional form of identification. Conditional Access is a tool that Microsoft Entra uses to allow or deny access to resources based on identity signals. Microsoft Entra supports the registration of devices.

- Conditional Access
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    

### Correct Answer

- Conditional Access
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    

Conditional Access is a feature that Microsoft Entra uses to allow or deny access to resources based on identity signals, such as the device being used. SSO enables a user to sign in one time and use that credential to access multiple resources and applications from different providers. MFA is a process whereby a user is prompted during the sign-in process for an additional form of identification. Hybrid identity solutions create a common user identity for authentication and authorization to all resources, regardless of location.

    **This answer is correct.**
    

### Correct Answer

- Azure role-based access control (RBAC)
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    

Azure RBAC allows you to assign a set of permissions to a user or group. Resource tags are used to locate and act on resources associated with specific workloads, environments, business units, and owners. Resource locks prevent the accidental change or deletion of a resource. Key Vault is a centralized cloud service for storing an application secrets in a single, central location.

### Your Answer

- scope
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    

### Correct Answer

- scope
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    

An Azure RBAC role is applied to a scope, which is a resource or set of resources that the access applies to. Resource locks prevent the accidental change or deletion of a resource. Resource tags are used to locate and act on resources associated with specific workloads, environments, business units, and owners. Policies enforce different rules across resource configurations so that the configurations stay compliant with corporate standards.

## Question 34 of 50

Which two factors affect Azure costs? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

### Your Answer

- resource location
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    
- resource usage
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    

### Correct Answer

- resource location
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    
- resource usage
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    

Usage meters, such as CPU time, disk size, and write operations, are used to calculate your bill for an Azure resource. Deleting or deallocating a resource means that you will no longer be billed for it. Different regions can have different associated prices. Resources cost the same no matter the time of day or the day of the week.

## Question 36 of 50

Which are two common scenarios for using resource tags? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

### Your Answer

- associating costs with different environments
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    
- categorizing costs by department
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    

### Correct Answer

- associating costs with different environments
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    
- categorizing costs by department
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    

You can use tags to categorize costs by department, such as human resources, marketing, or finance, or by environment, such as test or production. Resizing underutilized virtual machines is a good cost saving measure and provisioning resources in lower cost regions is a good practice, but resource tags do not help with this.

## Question 37 of 50

You have an Azure virtual machine that is accessed only between 9:00 and 17:00 each day.

What should you do to minimize costs but preserve the associated hard disks and data?

### Your Answer

- Deallocate the virtual machine when it is not needed
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    

### Correct Answer

- Deallocate the virtual machine when it is not needed
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    

If you have virtual machine workloads that are used only during certain periods, but you run them every hour of every day, then you are wasting money. These virtual machines are great candidates to deallocate when not in use and start back when required to save compute costs while the virtual machines are deallocated.

### Your Answer

- Azure Monitor alerts
    
    **This answer is incorrect.**
    

### Correct Answer

- Azure Reservations
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    

Azure Reservations offers discounted prices on certain Azure services. Azure Reservations can save you up to 72 percent compared to pay-as-you-go prices. To receive a discount, you can reserve services and resources by paying in advance.Spending limits can suspend a subscription when the spend limit is reached.

## Question 40 of 50

What can be applied to a resource to prevent accidental deletion?

### Your Answer

- a resource lock
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    

### Correct Answer

- a resource lock
    
    **This answer is correct.**
    

A resource lock prevents resources from being accidentally deleted or changed. Resource tags offer the custom grouping of resources.
