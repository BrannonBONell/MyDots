# Create an Azure Resource

## Create a virtual Machine
- Sign in to the Azure Portal
-  Select Create a resource
	- Compute
		- Virtual Machine
			- Create

## Clean up

The sandbox automatically cleans up your resources when you're finished with this module.

When you're working in your own subscription, it's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources that you leave running can cost you money. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group to delete the entire set of resources.

### Summary

You should now be able to:

- Describe Azure regions, region pairs, and sovereign regions.
- Describe Availability Zones.
- Describe Azure datacenters.
- Describe Azure resources and Resource Groups.
- Describe subscriptions.
- Describe management groups.
- Describe the hierarchy of resource groups, subscriptions, and management groups.
