# Azure-storage-encryption

Azure Storage offers robust encryption for data at rest, ensuring that data stored within Azure's ecosystem meets security and compliance requirements automatically. This note will explore the key aspects of Azure Storage encryption, detailing how it works, why it's secure, and the configuration options available.

### Big Picture: Encryption for Data at Rest

Azure Storage encryption automatically safeguards data by using industry-standard encryption methods. The data stored on Azure Managed Disks, Blob Storage, Queue Storage, Cosmos DB, Table Storage, and Azure Files is encrypted using AES-256, ensuring confidentiality and compliance without requiring any code or application modifications from developers or administrators.

### Detailed Focus: Characteristics of Azure Storage Encryption

1. **Automatic Process**:
   - **Encryption**: Data is seamlessly encrypted before being written to any Azure storage medium. This encryption is performed using AES-256, recognized for its strength and reliability as a block cipher.
   - **Decryption**: Just as data is automatically encrypted before storage, it is automatically decrypted when accessed, ensuring smooth access without additional management steps.

2. **Transparency**:
   - Users experience no change in their interaction with storage accounts; encryption and decryption are transparent processes invisible to application and system operation.

3. **Enabled by Default**:
   - Every new storage account comes with encryption enabled as default, ensuring out-of-the-box security.
   - Encryption can neither be disabled nor configured incorrectly as itâ€™s enforced by the platform, ensuring high compliance.

4. **Key Management Options**:
   - **Microsoft-Managed Keys**: Azure manages the encryption keys, handling all cryptographic operations and key rotations without user intervention.
   - **Customer-Managed Keys (CMK)**: Users have the option to manage a cryptographic key set in Azure Key Vault, offering enhanced control over lifecycle management of their keys.

### Configuring Azure Storage Encryption

While encryption is enabled by default, users can choose how keys are managed:

1. **Microsoft-Managed Keys**:
   - Typically the lowest effort option; Azure automatically handles key management tasks, perfect for general security needs without specific regulatory requirements.

2. **Customer-Managed Keys**:
   - Offers greater control: these keys are stored in Azure Key Vault or in a managed hardware security module (HSM).
   - **Benefits**: Supports specific scenarios that require strict access control or routine key rotation schedules as mandated by corporate or regulatory requirements.

### Practical Implementation

- **Azure Portal** workflow involves choosing and setting encryption key management during initial storage account setup or by modifying settings for existing accounts.
- **Security Features**:
  - Integrates with **Azure Security Center** for continuous monitoring and threat assessments on managed keys.
  - Configure policies around key usage and renewal if key rotation aligns with evolving security best practices or regulatory frameworks.

### Questions to Consider

- What compliance or security requirements does your organization have concerning data encryption?
- Which encryption model (Microsoft-managed or customer-managed) aligns best with your governance and oversight policies?
- Does your organization benefit from added key management control offered by customer-managed keys, or is default key handling sufficient?

### Conclusion

Azure Storage encryption offers significant peace of mind due to its automatic implementation and robust configuration options. With the ability to manage keys or leave them to Azure's control, organizations can align encryption practices with both their operational security posture and compliance objectives.
