# deploy-azure-file-sync

Azure File Sync is a powerful tool that allows you to cache Azure File shares on-premises, effectively centralizing your organization's file shares in Azure while retaining the flexibility and performance of traditional file servers.

## Key Features of Azure File Sync

1. **Cache Management**:
   - Transforms Windows Server or cloud virtual machines into FAST caches for Azure File shares.
   
2. **Protocol Support**:
   - Compatible with various protocols available on Windows Server, including:
     - **SMB (Server Message Block)**
     - **NFS (Network File System)**
     - **FTPS (File Transfer Protocol Secure)**

3. **Global Cache Support**:
   - Supports the deployment of multiple caches globally, enabling distributed access to files.

## Cloud Tiering

- **Definition**:
  - An optional feature that stores frequently accessed files locally while tiering unused files to Azure Files based on defined policies.

- **How It Works**:
  - **Tiered Files**: When files are tiered, the original local file is replaced by a "pointer" known as a **reparse point**. The pointer acts as a URL to the actual file in Azure Files.
  
- **User Experience**:
  - **Accessing Tiered Files**: When a user accesses a tiered file, Azure File Sync retrieves it from Azure Files without the user needing to know it was stored in the cloud.
  - **Visual Indicators**: Tiered files display greyed-out icons with an offline "O" file attribute to indicate that the files are only stored in Azure and not on the local server.

## Scenarios for Using Azure File Sync

1. **Application Lift and Shift**:
   - Move applications requiring file access between Azure and on-premises systems, ensuring write access across both environments.

2. **Branch Office Support**:
   - Facilitate branch office data access by allowing local backup of files to Azure storage via Azure File Sync.

3. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**:
   - Azure Backup can back up on-premises data while retaining the capability to restore file metadata quickly for rapid disaster recovery.

4. **File Archiving with Cloud Tiering**:
   - Implement cloud tiering to store only frequently accessed files locally, optimizing storage costs and usage by moving non-used files to Azure Files.

## Conclusion

Azure File Sync stands out as an effective solution for managing file shares across on-premises and Azure environments. Its ability to cache data locally while leveraging the scalability of Azure helps organizations enhance their productivity and maintain data integrity. The option for cloud tiering adds an essential layer of data management, allowing for efficient usage of network resources.
