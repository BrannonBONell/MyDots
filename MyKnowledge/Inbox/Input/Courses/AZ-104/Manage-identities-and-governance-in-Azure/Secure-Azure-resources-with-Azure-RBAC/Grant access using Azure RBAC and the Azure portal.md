A co-worker named Alain at First Up Consultants needs permission to create and manage virtual machines for a project on which he's working. Your manager has asked that you handle this request. Using the best practice to grant users the least privileges to get their work done, you decide to assign Alain the Virtual Machine Contributor role for a resource group.

## Grant access

Follow this procedure to assign the Virtual Machine Contributor role to a user at the resource group scope.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) as an administrator that has permissions to assign roles, such as [User Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator) or [Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner).
    
2. In the Search box at the top, search for **Resource groups**.

3. In the list of resource groups, select a resource group.
    
    These steps use a resource group named **example-group**, but your resource group's name will be different.
    
4. On the left menu pane, select **Access control (IAM)**.
    
5. Select the **Role assignments** tab to display the current list of role assignments at this scope.

6. Select **Add** > **Add role assignment**.
    
    If you don't have permissions to assign roles, the **Add role assignment** option will be disabled.

14. Select **Review + assign** to assign the role.
    
    After a few moments, the user is assigned the Virtual Machine Contributor role at the resource group scope. The user can now create and manage virtual machines just within this resource group.
