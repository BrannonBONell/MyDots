		- Used to manage member and computer access
	- Microsoft 365 groups

- Use security groups to set permissions for all members at the same time instead of adding permissions to each member individually.
- Add Microsoft 365 groups to enable access for guest users outside your Entra organization
- Security groups can be made only by a Microsoft Entra administrator
- Normal users and Microsoft Entra admins can both use Microsoft 365 groups.

# Things to consider when adding group memebers
