# Determine Compliance

- Polices are defined, initiative definition created, and policies assigned to affected resources.
	- Last step is to evaluate the state of compliance for your scoped resources.

- Example shows how you can use the Compliance feature to look up for non-compliant initiatives, policies, and resources

Your policy conditions are evaluated against your existing scoped resources. Although the Azure portal doesn't show the evaluation logic, the compliance state results are shown. The compliance state result is either compliant or non-compliant.
