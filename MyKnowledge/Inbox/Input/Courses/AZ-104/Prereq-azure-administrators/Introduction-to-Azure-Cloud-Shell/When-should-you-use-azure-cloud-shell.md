#### Use Azure Cloud Shell When:

- You need a secure command-line session accessible from any browser-based device.
- You want to interact with Azure resources without installing additional software.
- You need to persist files between sessions.
- You prefer using either Bash or PowerShell for managing Azure resources.
- You want to edit files, such as scripts, using the Cloud Shell editor.

#### Avoid Using Azure Cloud Shell When:

- You plan to leave a session open for more than 20 minutes, as it will disconnect without warning.
- You require admin permissions like sudo access within Azure CLI or PowerShell.
- You need to install unsupported tools that require a custom environment.
- You need storage from multiple regions; only one region can be allocated.
- You need to open multiple sessions simultaneously, as only one instance is allowed at a time.
