# Determine Resource Limits

- Azure lets you view resource usage against limits.  This is helpful to track current usage, and plan for future use.

- The limits shown are the limits for your subscription.
- When you need to increase a default limit, there is a Request Increase link.
- All resources have a maximum limit listed in Azure [limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits?toc=%2fazure%2fnetworking%2ftoc.json).
- If you are at the maximum limit, the limit can't be increased.
