# Prepare the web application code

**Overview**: Creating a web application involves setting up the application’s code and integrating it with a **source control** system like Git. This ensures efficient collaboration, version tracking, and enables features like Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). In this guide, we'll focus on using the **Flask** framework to bootstrap a basic web application and cover how to integrate the code into **Git** for version control.

### **Bootstrapping a Web Application using Flask**:

1. **Flask Overview**:
    
    - **Flask** is a lightweight and popular web application framework for Python.
    - It’s designed for flexibility, allowing you to easily create web applications with minimal setup.
2. **Install Flask**:
    
    - First, ensure you have **Python** and **pip** (Python's package installer) installed.
    - Install Flask using the command:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `pip install flask`
        
3. **Creating a Minimal Flask Web Application**:
    
    - Once Flask is installed, you can create a basic web application with just a few lines of Python code:
        
        python
        
        Copy code
        
        `from flask import Flask app = Flask(__name__)  @app.route("/") def hello():     return "Hello World!\n"`
        
    - **Explanation**:
        - `Flask(__name__)`: Initializes a new Flask web application.
        - `@app.route("/")`: Defines a route for the web app that handles requests to the root URL ("/").
        - The `hello()` function returns "Hello World!" as a response to any incoming request to the root.
4. **Running the Flask App**:
    
    - Save the Python code in a file (e.g., `app.py`).
    - You can run the Flask application using the command:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `python app.py`
        
    - By default, the Flask application will run on `localhost:5000`. You can open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:5000` to see "Hello World!" displayed.

### **Adding Code to Source Control (Git)**:

1. **What is Git?**:
    
    - **Git** is a version control system that helps developers track code changes, collaborate with others, and maintain a history of the project.
    - Source control is crucial for collaboration and for setting up CI/CD pipelines for automatic deployment.
2. **Initialize a Git Repository**:
    
    - To begin tracking changes with Git, navigate to your project folder and run:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `git init`
        
    - This creates a new **Git repository** in your project directory.
3. **Add Files to the Repository**:
    
    - After initializing the repository, add your project files to be tracked by Git:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `git add .`
        
    - The `.` indicates that all files and directories should be staged for the next commit.
4. **Create Your First Commit**:
    
    - After staging the files, create your first **commit** (a snapshot of your code):
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
        
    - The `-m` flag allows you to include a message describing the changes made (in this case, "Initial commit").

### **Connecting to a Remote Repository (e.g., GitHub)**:

1. **Why Use a Remote Repository?**:
    
    - A **remote repository** allows you to store your code in a centralized location, like **GitHub**, **GitLab**, or **Azure Repos**. This enables collaboration, CI/CD integration, and disaster recovery.
    - If your local machine fails, your code will still be available in the remote repository.
2. **Pushing Code to GitHub**:
    
    - After creating a local repository, you can connect it to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub). Here's how:
        - Create a new repository on **GitHub**.
        - In your local Git repository, add the remote repository URL:
            
            bash
            
            Copy code
            
            `git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git`
            
        - Push your local commits to the remote repository:
            
            bash
            
            Copy code
            
            `git push -u origin master`
            
    - This command uploads your local changes to the **master** branch of the remote repository.

### **Benefits of Using Git for Source Control**:

1. **Version Control**:
    
    - Git allows you to keep track of changes over time. You can always revert to previous versions of your code if something goes wrong.
2. **Collaboration**:
    
    - Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously, with Git merging changes and preventing conflicts.
3. **Commit History**:
    
    - Every commit serves as a historical record of your project’s development, making it easier to track bugs and features.
4. **Backup and Recovery**:
    
    - With remote repositories, your code is backed up online, ensuring you don’t lose progress if something happens to your local machine.

### **Introduction to CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)**:

1. **What is CI/CD?**:
    
    - **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automates the process of merging code changes into a shared repository. CI ensures that the code is built and tested every time a change is made.
    - **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automatically deploys the latest changes to production after passing all tests. This ensures rapid and frequent deployment of updates.
2. **How Git Enables CI/CD**:
    
    - Once your code is hosted in a Git-based remote repository (e.g., GitHub), you can connect it to CI/CD services like **Azure Pipelines**, **GitHub Actions**, or **Jenkins**.
    - These services monitor your repository and trigger automatic builds, tests, and deployments whenever you push new code.
3. **Setting Up CI/CD**:
    
    - For example, with **Azure DevOps** or **GitHub Actions**, you can define a **pipeline** that:
        - Pulls your code from the repository.
        - Runs automated tests to ensure nothing is broken.
        - Builds the application (e.g., compiling or packaging the code).
        - Deploys the application to a live environment (like **Azure App Service**).

### **Summary**:

1. **Flask** is a simple web framework that allows you to quickly bootstrap web applications with minimal code.
2. **Git** provides an essential tool for source control, allowing you to track changes, collaborate, and integrate with CI/CD pipelines.
3. Once the app is created, it is best practice to use **source control** (such as Git) to manage your codebase.
4. **CI/CD** automates the testing, building, and deployment of code, enabling frequent and reliable deployments.

These notes cover the essential steps in bootstrapping a web application, integrating it with Git, and enabling CI/CD for continuous development and deployment.
