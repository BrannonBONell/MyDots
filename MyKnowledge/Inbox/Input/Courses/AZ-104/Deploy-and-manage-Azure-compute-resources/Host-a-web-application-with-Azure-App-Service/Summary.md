You successfully created and deployed a web application to Azure App Service.

App Service simplifies managing and controlling your web app in comparison to traditional hosting options. Your App Service Plan can help you reduce the time and effort spent running and managing your web app, and provides advanced cloud features such as autoscaling and Azure DevOps integration.

## Clean up

The sandbox automatically cleans up your resources when you're finished with this module.

When you're working in your own subscription, it's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources that you leave running can cost you money. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group to delete the entire set of resources.
