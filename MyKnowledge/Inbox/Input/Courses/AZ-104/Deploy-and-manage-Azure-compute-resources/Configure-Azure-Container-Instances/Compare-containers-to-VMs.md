# Compare containers to VMs

**Overview:** Containers represent the next stage of virtualization, allowing multiple applications to run within the same operating system instance while maintaining isolation. While virtual machines virtualize the hardware, containers virtualize the operating system, providing a lightweight alternative to traditional virtual machines.

### **Comparison of Containers and Virtual Machines**:

|**Feature**|**Containers**|**Virtual Machines**|
|---|---|---|
|**Isolation**|Lightweight isolation from the host and other containers.|Complete isolation from the host OS and other VMs.|
|**Operating System**|Runs user-mode parts of the OS, uses fewer system resources.|Runs a full OS, including the kernel, which uses more resources.|
|**Deployment**|Deploy via Docker or orchestrators like Azure Kubernetes.|Deploy via Hyper-V, Windows Admin Center, or System Center.|
|**Persistent Storage**|Uses **Azure Disks** or **Azure Files** for storage.|Uses **virtual hard disks (VHDs)** or SMB file shares.|
|**Fault Tolerance**|Orchestrators recreate failed containers on another node.|VMs fail over to another server and restart the OS.|

### **Advantages of Containers**:

1. **Flexibility and Speed**:
    
    - Containers allow for rapid development, testing, and deployment. This increases agility in building and shipping applications.
2. **Testing**:
    
    - Simplified testing, as containers encapsulate everything the app needs (code, libraries, tools). You can replicate consistent environments across various stages (development, testing, production).
3. **App Deployment**:
    
    - Streamlined and accelerated app deployment. Containers can be deployed and started in seconds.
4. **Workload Density**:
    
    - Containers support higher workload density, allowing you to run more applications on the same hardware, improving resource utilization.

### **Container Images**:

- **Definition**: A container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application.
    
    **Components** of a Container Image:
    
    - **Code**: The applicationâ€™s source code.
    - **Runtime**: The environment necessary for executing the app.
    - **System Tools**: Utilities required by the application.
    - **System Libraries**: Shared libraries used by the app.
    - **Settings**: Configuration parameters specific to the app.
- **Portability**: Once created, a container image can run consistently across different environments, making it highly portable.

### **Benefits of Containers**:

- **Flexibility**: Faster development and easier sharing of containerized applications.
- **Testing**: Simplified configuration and testing environments.
- **Deployment**: Accelerated app deployment with minimal overhead.
- **Efficiency**: Increased resource utilization by supporting higher density workloads compared to traditional VMs.
