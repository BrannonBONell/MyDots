# Create Kusto queries

### Kusto Query Language (KQL) in Azure Monitor Log Analytics: Overview

**Kusto Query Language (KQL)** is used in **Azure Monitor Log Analytics** to create powerful queries that retrieve and consolidate data from the Azure Monitor Logs repository. With KQL, you can create simple or complex queries to analyze your monitoring data effectively.

### Key Concepts for Writing Log Queries

1. **View Table Data**
    
    - Retrieve and explore the data stored in the Azure Monitor Logs repository.
    - You can view the raw log data in table format before creating queries.
2. **Create Queries**
    
    - **Simple Queries**: Retrieve basic data such as CPU usage, memory consumption, etc.
    - **Complex Queries**: Combine data from multiple sources, perform calculations, and apply filters or summaries.
3. **Filter and Summarize**
    
    - Use filters to refine search results, such as filtering by time, specific events, or resource types.
    - Summarize data using functions like `count`, `sum`, `average`, etc.
4. **Add Visualizations**
    
    - Transform your query results into visual representations (e.g., charts and graphs) to better understand your systemâ€™s health and performance.

### Things to Accomplish with Log Queries

- **Create and Save Searches**: Design queries and save them for later analysis.
- **Automate Searches**: Schedule log queries to run automatically at specific intervals.
- **Generate Alerts**: Set up alerts based on query results to notify you when certain conditions are met.
- **Visualize Data**: Add visual elements like charts to your saved searches for easy monitoring.
- **Export Data**: Export query results to tools like Power BI or Excel for further analysis.

By mastering KQL and log queries, you can efficiently monitor, analyze, and act on data stored in Azure Monitor Logs, enhancing the performance and health of your Azure environment.
