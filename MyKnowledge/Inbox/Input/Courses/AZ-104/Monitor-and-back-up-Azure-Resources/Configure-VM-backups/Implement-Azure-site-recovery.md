# Implement Azure site recovery

**Scenario Overview**: You work for a large e-commerce company that faced a major outage due to a power failure in your primary data center. To prevent this from happening again, you plan to implement **Azure Site Recovery (ASR)**. This will enable you to replicate your workloads to a secondary location, allowing your online platform to remain accessible even during outages.

### **Key Features of Azure Site Recovery**:

1. **Workload Replication Options**:
    - **Replicate Azure Virtual Machines**: From one Azure region to another, ensuring cloud-based workloads are always available.
    - **Replicate On-Premises Systems**: Includes VMware VMs, Hyper-V VMs, physical servers (Windows/Linux), and Azure Stack VMs to Azure.
    - **Replicate AWS Windows Instances**: To Azure for business continuity across cloud environments.
    - **On-Premises to Secondary Site**: Replication for on-premises VMware, Hyper-V, and physical servers to a backup site.

### **Benefits of Azure Site Recovery**:

1. **Consolidated Management**:
    
    - Manage **replication, failover, and failback** from a **single location** in the Azure portal.
2. **Reduced Cost and Complexity**:
    
    - Eliminates the need for a secondary datacenter by replicating workloads to Azure, reducing operational costs and complexity.
3. **Replication Resilience**:
    
    - **Orchestrated replication** without intercepting your application data, utilizing **Azure Storage’s resilience** to store replicated data securely.
    - Azure virtual machines are automatically created based on the replicated data during failover.
4. **Continuous Replication**:
    
    - Supports **continuous replication** for Azure and VMware virtual machines, with replication frequencies as low as **30 seconds for Hyper-V VMs**.
5. **Snapshot Recovery Points**:
    
    - **App-consistent snapshots** capture disk data, in-memory data, and all active transactions to ensure a safe recovery point.
6. **Failover and Easy Fall Back**:
    
    - **Planned failovers** (zero data loss) for expected outages and **unplanned failovers** (minimal data loss, based on replication frequency).
    - **Easy fallback** to the primary site once the issue is resolved.
7. **Integration with Azure Services**:
    
    - Simplified network management with **reserved IP addresses**, **load balancer configuration**, and integration with **Azure Traffic Manager** for efficient failover switching.

### **Why Use Azure Site Recovery?**:

- **Availability**: Ensure that your applications are always accessible, even during disasters.
- **Business Continuity**: Keep serving customers, avoiding financial losses and reputational damage.
- **Resilience**: Leverage Azure’s scalable and robust infrastructure for disaster recovery.

By implementing Azure Site Recovery, you can protect your business-critical applications and keep them running smoothly, even in the face of regional outages.

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|**Consolidated management**|Set up and manage replication, failover, and failback from a single location in the Azure portal.|
|**Reduced cost and complexity**|Replicate to Azure to eliminate the cost and complexity of maintaining a secondary datacenter.|
|**Replication resilience**|Orchestrate replication without intercepting your app data and gain the resilience of Azure Storage. When failover occurs, Azure virtual machines are created, based on the replicated data.|
|**Continuous replication**|Access continuous replication for Azure virtual machines and VMware virtual machines, and replication frequency as low as 30 seconds for Hyper-V.|
|**Snapshot recovery points**|Replicate by using recovery points with app-consistent snapshots that capture disk data, all data in memory, and all transactions in process.|
|**Failover and easy fall back**|Run planned failovers for expected outages with zero-data loss. Run unplanned failovers with minimal data loss depending on replication frequency. Easily fall back to your primary site when it's available again.|
|**Integration**|Integrate with Azure for simple application network management, including reserving IP addresses, configuring load-balancers, and integrating Azure Traffic Manager for efficient network switchovers.|
