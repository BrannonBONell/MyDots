Azure offers **four primary backup options** for virtual machines (VMs), each suited for different scenarios and configurations. Here's a breakdown of the options, scenarios they best support, and key points to consider:

---

### **1. Azure Backup**

- **Scenario**: Backing up Azure virtual machines running **production workloads** (Windows and Linux VMs).
- **Description**:
    - Takes a **snapshot** of your VM and stores the data as **recovery points** in **geo-redundant** recovery vaults.
    - Provides **application-consistent** backups.
    - Restore options include either the **entire VM** or **specific files** from recovery points.

---

### **2. Azure Site Recovery**

- **Scenario**: For **disaster recovery**, ensuring business continuity in case of region-wide failures.
- **Description**:
    - **Replicates** your VMs to an Azure region of your choice.
    - Protects against major **disasters** such as natural events or widespread service interruptions.
    - Allows for **quick recovery** of specific applications or full VM recovery.

---

### **3. Azure Managed Disks - Snapshot**

- **Scenario**: Backing up VMs in **development and test environments**.
- **Description**:
    - A **read-only** full copy of a managed disk.
    - **Independent** of the source disk.
    - Used to create **new managed disks** from the snapshot.
    - **Billing** is based on the actual size of the data used in the snapshot (e.g., if a 64 GB disk has only 10 GB used, you'll be billed for 10 GB).

---

### **4. Azure Managed Disks - Image**

- **Scenario**: For creating **custom virtual machines** in bulk.
- **Description**:
    - Capture an **image** of your custom virtual hard disk (VHD) or generalized VM using **Sysprep**.
    - Useful for creating **hundreds of VMs** from a single custom image without copying or managing any storage accounts.
    - The image includes both the **operating system** and **data disks** of the VM.

---

### **Key Considerations for Images vs. Snapshots**

1. **Images**:
    
    - Ideal for **generalized VMs** that have been deallocated.
    - **Includes all disks** attached to the VM.
    - Best for **creating new VMs** with the same disk configurations.
2. **Snapshots**:
    
    - Represents a **point-in-time copy** of **one disk**.
    - Does **not coordinate** with other disks, which can be an issue for configurations requiring disk synchronization (e.g., striping).
    - Suitable for **simple single-disk VMs**.
3. **Operating System Disk Backups**:
    
    - You can take either a **snapshot** or an **image** of a single disk.
    - Both can be used to create a **new VM**.

This guide helps in selecting the appropriate backup method for various scenarios, ensuring that your VMs are protected based on your environmentâ€™s needs.

|**Azure backup option**|**Configuration scenarios**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|**Azure Backup**|_Back up Azure virtual machines running production workloads_  <br>  <br>_Create application-consistent backups for both Windows and Linux virtual machines_|Azure Backup takes a snapshot of your virtual machine and stores the data as recovery points in geo-redundant recovery vaults. When you restore from a recovery point, you can restore your entire virtual machine or specific files only.|
|**Azure Site Recovery**|_Quickly and easily recover specific applications_  <br>  <br>_Replicate to the Azure region of your choice_|Azure Site Recovery protects your virtual machines from a major disaster scenario when a whole region experiences an outage due to a major natural disaster or widespread service interruption.|
|**Azure managed disks - snapshot**|_Quickly and easily back up your virtual machines that use Azure managed disks at any point in time_  <br>  <br>_Support development and test environments_|An Azure managed disks snapshot is a read-only full copy of a managed disk stored as a standard managed disk by default. A snapshot exists independent of the source disk and can be used to create new managed disks. Each snapshot is billed based on the actual size used. If you create a snapshot of a managed disk with a capacity of 64 GB used only 10 GB, Azure bills you for 10 GB.|
|**Azure managed disks - image**|_Create an image from your custom virtual hard disk (VHD) in an Azure storage account or directly from a generalized (via Sysprep) virtual machine_  <br>  <br>_Create hundreds of virtual machines by using your custom image without copying or managing any storage account_|Azure managed disks also support creating a managed custom image. This process captures a single image that contains all managed disks associated with a virtual machine, including both the operating system and data disks.|
