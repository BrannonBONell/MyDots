After backing up your virtual machine, you can restore it using **snapshots** or **recovery points** stored in the **Recovery Services vault**. Hereâ€™s what you need to know:

### **Key Points about Restoring Virtual Machines**:

1. **Selecting Recovery Points**:
    
    - You can choose specific recovery points from the snapshots stored in the vault.
    - These recovery points represent points-in-time to which you can restore the machine.
2. **Restore Operation**:
    
    - When you initiate a restore, **Azure Backup** creates a restore job.
    - This job handles the restore process and allows you to track its progress.
3. **Notifications**:
    
    - **Temporary notifications** inform you about the restore job's progress.
    - You can monitor these job notifications in the **Azure portal**.

This streamlined process ensures that you can quickly restore your virtual machines to a previous state, minimizing downtime and data loss.
