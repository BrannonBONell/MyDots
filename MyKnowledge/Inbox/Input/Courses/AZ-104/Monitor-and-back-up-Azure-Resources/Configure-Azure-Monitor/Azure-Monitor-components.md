# Azure Monitor components

**Monitoring** is essential for collecting and analyzing data to track the **performance**, **health**, and **availability** of your business applications and the resources that support them. A solid monitoring strategy enables early detection of critical issues, allowing you to resolve problems before they escalate.

Azure provides a variety of services to support a **comprehensive monitoring solution** that works for both **cloud** and **on-premises resources**. Here’s a breakdown of the key Azure services and components involved in monitoring.

### **Key Components of Azure Monitoring**:

1. **Core Monitoring Services**:
    
    - **Azure Monitor Metrics**: Collects **numerical data** on performance, helping you understand **resource usage** and **operational health**.
    - **Azure Monitor Logs**: Gathers **log data** for more in-depth analysis, enabling you to query and interact with large amounts of diagnostic information.
2. **Monitoring Sources**:
    
    - Metrics and logs data come from sources like:
        - **Azure subscriptions and tenants**
        - **Azure services** (e.g., VMs, databases)
        - **On-premises resources**
        - **Applications**
3. **Azure Monitor Insights**:
    
    - **Application Insights**: Provides **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)** features to monitor your app’s performance, including tracing and logging for deeper analysis.
        - Works with Azure services like **VMs**, **Container Instances**, **Azure Cosmos DB**, and more.
4. **Visualization**:
    
    - Use tools like **Azure Workbooks** and **Power BI** for **dashboards** and **custom views** to visualize metrics and logs.
    - Configurable dashboards help you quickly see the health of your resources.
5. **Analysis**:
    
    - **Log Analytics** (part of Azure Monitor Logs) allows you to create and run **log queries** to filter, search, and analyze data interactively.
    - Metrics and log analysis help identify trends and operational issues.
6. **Respond**:
    
    - **Alerting**: Set up **alerts** for specific metrics or logs that notify you of critical conditions.
    - **Automation**: Use **automated actions** (such as auto-scaling or running scripts) based on alert conditions, allowing for proactive incident response.
7. **Integration**:
    
    - **APIs, Azure CLI, PowerShell**: Export log query results or metrics to external systems.
    - Automate the export of log data to **Azure Storage** or **Event Hubs**.
    - Use **Azure Logic Apps** to build workflows and automate responses or data transfers.
