# What is source control

**Source control systems** (or **version control systems**) are essential tools for software development teams to manage and track code changes. They facilitate collaboration, protect code history, and enhance productivity in multi-developer projects.

#### Key Benefits of Source Control

1. **Change Tracking & History**:
    
    - Source control systems take snapshots of files, enabling developers to review and roll back changes when needed.
    - Maintains a history of changes, making it easier to understand the evolution of code and resolve issues.
2. **Collaboration & Conflict Resolution**:
    
    - Allows multiple developers to work on code simultaneously.
    - Merges contributions from various sources while managing and resolving conflicts.
3. **Code Security & Integrity**:
    
    - Protects source code from accidental deletions, errors, and potential data loss.
    - Mitigates risks of human error and unintended consequences by keeping a single master version of the code at a time.
4. **Foundation for DevOps & Agile Practices**:
    
    - Supports key practices such as **Agile**, **Continuous Integration (CI)**, and **DevOps**.
    - Version control is essential to maintaining code quality, managing workflows, and delivering code rapidly.

#### Why Version Control is Essential

- **Experimentation**: Safely test new features and ideas without risking existing code.
- **IP Protection**: Preserves intellectual property (IP) and mitigates risks.
- **Risk Management**: Helps teams quickly respond to and recover from issues.
- **Continuous Delivery**: Accelerates time-to-market, making version control essential for CI/CD pipelines.

#### Perspectives on Version Control

- **For Developers**:
    
    - A daily tool that enables efficient work, collaboration, and experimentation.
    - Provides clear records of changesâ€”who made them, when, and what was modified.
- **For Management**:
    
    - Ensures **IP security** and **risk management**.
    - Supports faster delivery through **Continuous Delivery** and **Continuous Integration**.

By incorporating version control systems, organizations create a strong foundation for development and collaboration, ultimately delivering higher value to their customers.
