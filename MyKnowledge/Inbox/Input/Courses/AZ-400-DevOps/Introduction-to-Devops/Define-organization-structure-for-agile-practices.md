# Define organization structure for agile practices

- Good governance in organizations often has relatively rigid rules, operating structures, and methods, but avoid a broad delegation of authority.
- Business environments today need to be able to change quickly.

## Horizontal vs. Vertical teams

- Horizontal team structures divide teams according to architecture.
- Example; 
![Diagram of Teams has been divided into UI, SOA, and Data. Each team has Email, Voice, and TV.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/introduction-to-devops/media/devops-ds-image-101-cd10ac81-579ed473-4116f357.png)

- Vertical team structures span the architecture and are aligned with skillsets or disciplines

- Vertical teams are shown to be more successful in outcomes in Agile projects.  
- A key benefit of Vertical team-structure is that scaling can be done by adding teams.
- In this Example feature teams have been created rather than project team;
