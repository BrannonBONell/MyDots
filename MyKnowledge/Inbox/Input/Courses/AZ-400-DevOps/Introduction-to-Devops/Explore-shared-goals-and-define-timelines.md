# Shared goals and define timelines

## Shared goals

These outcomes should include specific, measurable targets like:
- Reduce the time spent on fixing bugs by 60%.
- Reduce the time spent on unplanned work by 70%.
- Reduce the out-of-hours work required by staff to no more than 10% of total working time.
- Remove all direct patching of production systems.

## Define timelines for goals

- Measurable goals need to have timelines
- It's easy to set long-term goals, but its also easy to put off work if not required to do it.
- Ongoing series of short term goals are necessary, projects should have timelines that span anywhere from a few months to a year to two in any DevOps transformation projects.

- Every few weeks, the improvements should be clear and measurable, Ideally evident to the organization or consumer.
- A review should occur after each short-term goal to help plan the next one

There are several advantages to short-term goals:
- It is easier to change plans or priorities when necessary.
- The reduced delay between doing work and getting feedback helps ensure that the learnings and feedback are incorporated quickly.
- It is easier to keep organizational support when positive outcomes are clear.
