# What is DevOps

Essential practices include agile planning, continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD), and monitoring of applications.

## Understand your cycle time

Â You start with observing business, market, needs, current user behavior, and available telemetry data. Then you orient with the enumeration of options for what you can deliver, perhaps with experiments. Next, you decide what to pursue, and you act by delivering working software to real users. You can see all occurring in some cycle time.

## Become Data Informed

Use data to inform what to do in your next cycle.  Fail fast on effects that do not advance the business, and double down on outcomes that support the business.  This approach can be called pivot or preserve.

## Strive for validated learning

Cycle time determines how quickly to gather feedback to determine what happens in the next loop.  Feedback collected with each cycle should be factual, actionable data.  This is called validated learning

## Shorten your cycle time

Adopt DevOps Practices;
- You shorten your cycle time by working in smaller batches.
- Using more automation.
- Hardening your release pipeline.
- Improving your telemetry.
- Deploying more frequently.

## Optimize validated learning

The more frequently you can deploy the more you can experiment.  More opportunity to pivot or persevere and gain validated learning each cycle.  Acceleration is the value of improvement.  The sum of progress that you achieve and the failures that you avoid.
