# Explore the DevOps Journey

Goal is to shorten cycle time.  Start with a release pipeline, how long does it take to deploy a change of one line of code or configuration? That is the brake on your velocity.
- Continuous integration drives the ongoing merging and testing of code, leading to an early finding of defects.
- Less time wasted fighting merge issues and rapid feedback for development teams.

- Continuous Delivery (CD) helps organizations quickly fix bugs and respond to changing business requirements.

- Version Control usually through (Git), enables teams to communicate effectively during daily development activities.
- Integrate with software development tools for monitoring activities such as deployments

- Use Agile planning and lean project management techniques to:
	- Plan and isolate work into sprints
	- Manage team capacity and help teams quickly adapt to changing business needs
	- DevOps Definition of done is working software collecting telemetry against the intended business goals.

- Monitoring and Logging of running applications.  Includes production environments for application health and customer usage.  Helps organizations create a hypothesis and quickly validate or disprove of strategies.  Rich data is captujred and stored in various logging formats.

- The cloud has removed traditional bottelnecks and helped commoditize infrastructure.  You can use (IaaS) to lift and shift your existing apps or (PaaS) to gain unprecedented productivity.

- (IaC) enables the automation and validation of the creation and teardown of environments to help deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms.

-  Use Microservices architecture to isolate business use cases into small reusable services that communicate via interface contracts.  This architecture enables scalability and efficiency.

- Containers are the next evolution in virtualization.  They're much more lightweight than VMs, allow much faster hydration, and easily configure files.
