GitHub **Projects Views** help you visualize and manage information by adjusting layout, grouping, sorting, and filtering options. Here’s how to set up and use these features effectively:

---

### Key Features of Project Views

- **Views**: Each view is displayed on a separate tab, allowing custom visualization of specific project aspects, such as task status or team workload.
- **Project Command Palette**: Access settings and run commands within the project quickly.

### Using the Project Command Palette

1. Open the command palette:
    - Press **Command + K** (Mac) or **Ctrl + K** (Windows/Linux).
2. Type part of a command or browse through available options.

#### Common Commands

- **Switch layout**: Change to **Table** view.
- **Show**: Display items by **Milestone**.
- **Sort by**: Arrange items by **Assignee**, **Date**, etc.
- **Remove sort-by** or **group-by**.
- **Group by**: Organize items by **Status** or custom fields.

- **Delete view**: Remove an existing view.

### Creating a New Project View
