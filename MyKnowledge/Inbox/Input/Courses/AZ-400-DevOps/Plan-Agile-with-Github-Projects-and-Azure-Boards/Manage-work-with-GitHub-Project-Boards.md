# Manage work with GitHub Project Boards


**GitHub Projects** enables you to effectively manage and plan deliverables, release dates, and iterations. Hereâ€™s a concise guide to setting up and managing iterations:

---

### What are Iterations?

- **Iterations** represent specific time blocks, allowing you to:
    - Schedule work over set time frames.
    - Control time length for each block.
    - Add breaks for scheduled time away.
