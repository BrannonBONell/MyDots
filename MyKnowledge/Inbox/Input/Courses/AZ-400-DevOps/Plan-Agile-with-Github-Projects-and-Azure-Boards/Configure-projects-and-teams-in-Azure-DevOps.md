# Configure projects and teams in Azure DevOps

In todayâ€™s fast-paced software landscape, Azure DevOps offers a foundation for managing projects and teams to ensure efficient collaboration, clear accountability, and streamlined workflows. This approach supports agility, faster delivery, and alignment with business goals.

### Planning

1. **Analyze Organizational Structure**: Assess the operational model and roles, considering:
    
    - Department divisions
    - Current business goals
    - Cross-project dependencies
2. **Define Project Scope and Objectives**: Identify:
    
    - Project goals, scope, and stakeholders
    - Team structures (cross-functional or role-based)
3. **Establish Roles and Responsibilities**: Common roles include:
    
    - Developers, testers, product owners, Scrum masters, and project managers
4. **Set Governance Policies**: Develop guidelines for:
    
    - Version control, branching strategies, code reviews, and compliance checks
5. **Agile Process Selection**: Customize tools in Azure DevOps to support:
    
    - Project templates for consistency
    - Work item tracking, pipelines, and test plans

### Implementation

1. **Project Setup**:
    
    - Choose visibility (public or private) and version control (Git or TFVC).
    - Select work item process:
        - **Agile**: Iterative development with backlogs, sprints, and visual boards.
        - **Basic**: Simple work items, suited for small teams.
        - **CMMI**: Structured processes for compliance.
        - **Scrum**: Sprint-based framework for incremental work.
        - **Customized Scrum**: Tailored Scrum with flexible work items.
2. **Build Team Structure**:
    
    - Adjust the default team or add new teams based on project needs.
    - Assign administrators and team members.
3. **Set Up Area Paths**:
    
    - Use area paths to organize work items and assign specific areas to each team for clear responsibility.
4. **Configure Permissions and Resources**:
    
    - Customize permissions for team members (default Contributors role).
    - Assign resources (repositories, boards, pipelines, test plans) to teams.

### Continuous Improvement

Regularly review project and team settings based on feedback to ensure efficient software development, regardless of complexity. Adjust teams, processes, and resources to optimize performance and meet evolving needs.

This approach helps your organization maximize productivity, improve collaboration, and continuously deliver high-quality software.
