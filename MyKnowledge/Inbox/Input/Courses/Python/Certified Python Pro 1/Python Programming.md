# Object Oriented Programming

## Central Idea Behind OOP: The Class
- **Class**: A template for an object that defines a set of standardized qualities or attributes and behaviors or methods (functions).

## Instances
- When an object is created from a class, it's called an **instance**. An instance can be considered a child of the template (class).

### Example:
If we have a class called `Car`, it might have attributes like `color`, `make`, and `model`, and behaviors like `drive` and `stop`. An instance of this class could be a specific car, say, a red Toyota Corolla.

## Super-Class & Sub-Class
- **Super-Class**: Also known as the parent class, it's the class whose properties and methods are inherited by other classes.
- **Sub-Class**: Also known as the child class, it inherits properties and methods from the super-class but can also have additional properties or methods specific to it.

### Example:
Consider a `Vehicle` class as a super-class with attributes like `wheels` and methods like `move`. A sub-class could be `Bicycle`, which inherits properties from `Vehicle` but may add its own specific properties or methods.
