# Get better aim
>[!cue] This is how you aim better

1. Stretch your eyes
2. Get sunlight
3. Getting above average aim takes below average effort
4. Above average aim just a little bit structured routines
5. Great aim will get you out of most ranks in FPS games
6. Its your fault for losing
7. Look at your target and crosshair with more focus on the target
8. Up close focus on target, long range focus crosshair with a caveat when target is moving fast focus target when slow focus crosshair
9. pokeball wide wall and a hipfire map.
	1. Wide wall to practice long straight flicks undershoot and micro adjust
	2. Hipe fire maps are just micro adjustments straight line movements and 100% accuracy
10. Fugalaa xyz, and track stop
	1. FUgalaa just track it nice smallish crosshair with smooth movements only no flicking.
	2. Track stop builds up really fine motor skills for reactivity.
	3. smooth your Wrist maps should be the first aim map to play
11. Speed switching the static ones, and an evasive one.
12. You need to use arm and wrist for aiming.
13. Its all about calm aim
	1. Train your smoothness
		1. or lower your sensitivity so low it is calm
	2. Focus on smoothing out your wrist
	3. Focus on smothing out your arm
14. Different sensitivity for each game you play
15. Music while aim training may be the key to entering flow state in aim training
16. When first waking up don't get on pc or phone.
17. have two routines one warm up and one actualy practice
	1. Practice routine do when close to going to sleep
18. Rest days are more important than training days

# Sensitivity

- Try 1600 dpi
- 20cm to 80cm per 360 for sensitivity
- Slow
	- good for micro adjustments
	- smoother
	- easier to use
- Fast
	- Reactivity and tracking
	- harder to use

- Muscle memory isn't a thing
- Changing sensitivities can help with mouse control

- PSA method
	- In your game find the sensitivity that you can go a 360 degree turn using your mouse pad
	- enter it into the website [psa](https://jscalc.io/embed/vqOrqXRpMgmwb8tV](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbVBacG1qM3o0akhkaE85RG1UcklIYmNvUk4xd3xBQ3Jtc0tueWVaSTNrcVN4TXM0VmlsMDRfOFJsQUF0YUo1Ry12UTc3Z0xab1FNZ3A0OGhGMUJrU2phT1RwYjFfOWtEeGt2Q01PaUU2US03anF2MkRsOXd0MFNjVzItWEF0NjRlU0htYWx1V0NJWFNBNGdXOUZPUQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Fjscalc.io%2Fembed%2FvqOrqXRpMgmwb8tV&v=nbmf4kZ0LHI))
			it will give you two sensitivites, one high one low, test both, choose the one your preffered and then do it again 7 timnes.
- Copy the pros method
	- and copy there settings, as a baseline.
