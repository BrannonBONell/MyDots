## Part one Warm up

Meant to warm up your aim, warm up your wrist and warm up your arm. "Playing these two maps every day with different sensitivities allowed me to smooth out my wrist and make fine adjustments. without jitteriness "'

Way to play: 
	If you know your wrist is the issue and you want to fine tune that specifcally.
	Raise your sensitivity very high so only using wrist to aim on the maps.
	 If you want to train your arm specifically lower your sensitivity way down and only use your arm for aiming. Its and issue specific warmup.

- SYW (smooth your writst)

- VT Anti-Centering Valorant

## Part 2 Precision



- 6 sphere hipfire Voltaic Extra Small
	- Great for forcing proper technique and really focusing on the fine adjustments.

- VT Multiclick 120 Pokeball
	- Smooth fine adjustments between each target and focus on getting faster and faster

- VT One Wall 3 targets
	- This is a benchmark

- VT One Wall 5 Targets

## Part 3 The most helpful

"Smoothed out my aim and made me feel so much better whenever I played"

### Two track stop maps
	This is where customization comes in

These two maps help focus on smoothness, ability to track a target, and quickly react to a direction change.

### Next Three maps are for fine control and fine motor movements
