>  "A huge part of what you ask yourself in a relationship is, was this me? And the answer to that is almost always is at least somewhat.  And when I'm fighting with Tammy, I want to be convinced just like everybody else that finally, this is a time where I'm 100% right and she's wrong cause that would be real convenient and gratifying to that rage, impulse devil. And so I've learned to go away and think, well, yeah, probably I'm only like 99% perfect and like 1% of me probably made a mistake of some sort.  And so I can scour my conscience and find out what that is. And then usually when I found out what it is I think, oh yeah, its probably more like 70% me not 1%.  Then I can go tell her that and that usually works.  And sometimes it's 50% me and 10% me.  And who knows, depends on the situation.  __But generally the right place to look for the devil is in your own heart, and I would say that also applies on the broader social landscape, that's 100% for sure.__"

> "To the degree you are not living in paradise, you are insufficient.  That's a good way of thinking about it, and you can blame it on history, you can blame it on nature, and you can blame it on your fellow man.  And fair enough, man, I've seen people who have had terrible lives and who were in rough situations but even those people, some of them decided they were gonna take it upon themselves all of that atrocity and catastrophe and malevolence, they're gonna take it upon themselves and do good nonetheless.  And they became figures that were virtually saint like in their day to day operations. And so my might think, well, I've been traumatized and hurt and betrayed, malevolent, and so I'm doomed to cynicism and nihilism and despair and envy.  It's like, yeah, that's a good story and it's compelling and it's understandable.  But there are people who've been through worse than you who still do good. So that's also worth thinking about for like the rest of your life."

>  "Marriage is the bedrock, foundation stone of society.  Because society is the negotiated, productive, generous, peaceful solution to mutual being.  It's not just a metaphor marriage is the bedrock of society no, it's actually the bedrock or society."
